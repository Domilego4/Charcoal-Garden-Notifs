# Charcoal-Garden-Notifs


A mod that annoyingly plays the Minecraft "Pling.ogg" sound effect 10 times
whenever that one plant reaches the stage you were waiting for.

How to use:
- Open the Console
- Type "ccX = [0-5]" to select the x coordinate of the garden tile to check
- Type "ccY = [0-5]" to select the y coordinate of the garden tile to check
    - I haven't tested these with smaller gardens, so it might break, but I don't think it should.
- Type "ccStage = [0-4]" to select which stage you want a notification for.
	- 0 is None (no notifications)
	- 1, 2, 3 and 4 are Bud, Sprout, Bloom and Mature, respectively
	- You can also replace the number with "ccStages.<stage name>"
